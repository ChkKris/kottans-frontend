## Git Basic
### Git та GitHub
1. Through the Coursera platform, I received very meaningful and useful knowledge in the [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) course, namely:
- What is version control, its purpose. Difference between centralized and distributed.
- diff and patch
- Git
- Tracking Files
- The Basic Git Workflow
- Anatomy of a Commit Message
- Skipping the Staging Area
- Deleting and Renaming Files
- Undoing Changes Before Committing
- Amending Commits
- Rollbacks
- Identifying a Commit
- Working with Branches
- Merging
- Merge Conflicts

```
git commit -a
git log -p
git show
git diff
git diff --staged
git add -p
git mv
git rm
gitignore files
git checkout 
git reset
git commit --amend
git revert 
git branch
git branch <name> 
git branch -d <name>
git branch -D <name>
git checkout <branch> 
git checkout -b <branch>
git merge <branch> 
git merge --abort
git log --graph --oneline
```

2. Walking through the educational game [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) of learning commands in Git was fun and very rewarding since I had never experienced it in practice before.

## Linux CLI and HTTP
1. With the help of the resource [Linux Survival (4 modules)](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) I studied the commands that I had not previously used in my work, I think that they will be useful to me.

2. The material described in turned out to be quite interesting, some of the information was new to me.  
[HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Should Understand - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)  
[HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Should Understand - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

## Git Collaboration
1. Weeks 3 and 4 of the [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) course did not contain much new information for me, since I learned it in the penultimate assignment of the course. Rather, it helped me refresh my knowledge. Perhaps this task would be useful before the pull request element, which would allow for fewer mistakes and save time.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
1. A good basic knowledge is given by the course ["Introduction to HTML and CSS"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers). I have already gone through it before, I was able to apply the learned tags and styles in practice. Also useful for working in Sublime Text was Browser Sync. I have been using it for some time at work.  
I also want to note that there is a source code on GitHub https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course4 , which is useful when performing practical tasks.

## Responsive Web Design
1. [Responsive web design basics](https://web.dev/i18n/en/responsive-web-design-basics/) the article perfectly describes which meta tags are key when developing responsive design for any device.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    …
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    …
  </head>
  …
 ```
 
 ```
 img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
 ```  
 
Using CSS media queries for fast response:  

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    …
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">
    …
  </head>
  …
```


2. You can streamline your knowledge of FLEXBOX with the help of the material presented https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x.  
It was very helpful. I also liked that you can immediately put the knowledge into practice using the template layout.

`flex/inline-flex` `flex-wrap` `flex-direction` `justify-content` `align-items` `order` 

`align-self` `flex-basis` `flex-grow` `flex-shrink` `flex-grow` `flex-basis`


3. [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) A fun game to test yourself.

4. [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm) Before this tutorial, I was not familiar with Grid Layout. It got me interested and I want to try it in practice.  

- **fr** is a unit of length that allows you to create flexible tracks. It is not a unit in the usual sense, and therefore cannot be represented or combined with other types of units in calc() expressions. The total size of the fixed rows or columns is subtracted from the available space of the grid container. The remaining space is divided between rows and columns with flexible sizes in proportion to their ratio.

- Grid container declaration options `grid` `inline-grid`

- Explicit grid definition `grid-template-rows` `grid-template-columns` `grid-template` `grid-template-areas`

- Definition of an implicit grid `grid-auto-columns` `grid-auto-rows` `grid-auto-flow`
