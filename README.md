## Git Basic
### Git та GitHub
1. Through the Coursera platform, I received very meaningful and useful knowledge in the [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) course, namely:
- What is version control, its purpose. Difference between centralized and distributed.
- diff and patch
- Git
- Tracking Files
- The Basic Git Workflow
- Anatomy of a Commit Message
- Skipping the Staging Area
- Deleting and Renaming Files
- Undoing Changes Before Committing
- Amending Commits
- Rollbacks
- Identifying a Commit
- Working with Branches
- Merging
- Merge Conflicts

```
git commit -a
git log -p
git show
git diff
git diff --staged
git add -p
git mv
git rm
gitignore files
git checkout 
git reset
git commit --amend
git revert 
git branch
git branch <name> 
git branch -d <name>
git branch -D <name>
git checkout <branch> 
git checkout -b <branch>
git merge <branch> 
git merge --abort
git log --graph --oneline
```

2. Walking through the educational game [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) of learning commands in Git was fun and very rewarding since I had never experienced it in practice before.
